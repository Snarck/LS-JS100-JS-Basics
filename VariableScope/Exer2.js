What's my value? (Part 2)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

console.log(greeting);

let greeting = 'Hello world!';

I think it'll call a reference error. 

AHH I WAS RIGHT!

The reason is that let isn't a hoisted variable like Var is.  Var is borderline global.

/*
What's my value? (Part 1)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

console.log(greeting);

var greeting = 'Hello world!';

Should throw an error.  Greeting isn't instantiated. 

I was wrong, and here's why:

Var is hoisted, meaning that even if you instantiate it lower, the variable still exists.
But becaues it's instantiated lower, the value is undefined.

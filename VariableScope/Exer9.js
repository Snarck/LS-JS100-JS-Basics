/*


What's my value? (Part 9)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

const a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  a = 2;
}

myFunction(a);

I think this draws an error.  you can't assign a value to a const (TypeError?)
Otherwise, it'll output 1.

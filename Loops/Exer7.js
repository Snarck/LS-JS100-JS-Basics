And on and on and on

The following code keeps looping forever.
(You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.) Why is that? Also modify it so that it stops after the first iteration.


// There's nothing between the semicolons. It has no condition for the for loop to stop. 
for (let i = 0; ; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
}



*/

for (let i = 0; i < 1; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
}

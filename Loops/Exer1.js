/*

Loop and Log

Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs the current value of i to the console on each iteration. 
Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?
*/


for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  // include your code here
	console.log(i);
  //0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
}

//the for loop starts because i (which equals 0) is less than 10.   Every iteration, i+=2 i becomes the sum of itself +2. 
//stopping at 10 because it no longer meets the true value if 12 <= 10.

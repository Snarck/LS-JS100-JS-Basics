Display Division

Determine the output that the following code will log to the console.


function multiplesOfThree() {
  let divisor = 1;

  for (let dividend = 3; dividend <= 30; dividend += 3) {
    console.log(dividend + ' / ' + divisor + ' = 3');
    divisor += 1;
  }
}
each iteration would log 3 / 1 = 3
and then
6 / 2 = 3
9 / 3 = 3.. but none of this should matter because...


multiplesOfThree; -- there's no method? invocation call here? It shouldn't run anything.
(is this a trick question? seriously?)

Equality

In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines of code to check whether their return values differ and if so, how. 
Take a look at the MDN documentation on equality comparisons to read about how == and === differ.


'8' == 8;
'8' === 8;

=== = "strict equality"
== = "loose equality"

Informative snippits:

Double equals (==) will perform a type conversion when comparing two things, 
and will handle NaN, -0, and +0 specially to conform to IEEE 754 (so NaN != NaN, and -0 == +0);

Triple equals (===) will do the same comparison as double equals (including the special handling for NaN, -0, and +0)
but without type conversion; if the types differ, false is returned.

Triple equals does not do type conversion (and is faster because of it)

Double equals does a type conversion, making it a dosh slower than triple equals.

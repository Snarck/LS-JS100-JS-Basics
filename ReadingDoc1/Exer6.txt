What are the return values of the statements on lines 3 to 5? 
Refer to the MDN documentation about the Array object for help.

let trees = ['birch', 'pine', 'sequoia', 'palm tree'];

trees[trees.length - 1];
trees.pop();
trees[trees.length - 1];

Without using the MDN (but instead raw intuition!) 

trees[trees.length -1] should show 'sequoia'
trees.pop(); should remove the last element and return it, - so 'palm tree', 
trees[trees.length -1]; should now show 'pine' because the length of the array is now ['birch', 'pine', 'sequioia']


Now using MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

We see "pop" works as i thought: 
"The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array."
But let's look at .length on the MDN.
We see that: 
"
const fruits = [];
fruits.push("banana", "apple", "peach");
console.log(fruits.length); // 3
"

so console.log(fruits.length); // 3
In our intuit, we failed to account for the fact that length starts at 1 and accumulates, so to get the proper value
we have to subtract by one, meaning:
the first line is returns "palm tree", 
pop returns "palm tree", 
the third line returns "sequoia"

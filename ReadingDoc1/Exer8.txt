Consider the following code snippet:

let tweet = "I'm learning to program! Woooot :-) #javascript #launchschool";

let words = tweet.split(' ');
let isValid = tweet.length < 140;

What will the following statements return? 

typeof tweet;
typeof words;
typeof isValid;

tweet: String
words: Object
isValid: boolean

Thought process:

Tweet is a literal string, such as, "Hey dog", that's a string.  

Words is using the .split() method. It would split each of the words in tweet into an array where there's a space,
outputting something like, [I'm, learning, to, program...], arrays are objects.
isValid is a bit tricky.  I believe it would be storing the value of "true". 
So it's a boolean. 

But if it's storing the value of tweet.length < 140;, it's a number.

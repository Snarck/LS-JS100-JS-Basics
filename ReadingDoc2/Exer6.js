/*
Which year is this?

The MDN page for Date lists two methods to get the year of a date.

let today = new Date(); //assigns the four-digit value of hte current (local) year to the variable Year

today.getYear(); // is depreciated and shouldn't be used, it would return 122
today.getFullYear(); // returns year according to local time such as 2022

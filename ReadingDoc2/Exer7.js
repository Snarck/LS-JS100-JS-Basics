/*
Argument Signatures
How many arguments does the Array.prototype.join() method expect? What happens if you call it with less or more arguments?

join() takes a single seperator (such as ' ') as an argument. 
If you don't input any parameters, it will simply concat the array into a single string seperated by a comma:
let dog = ['bark', 'wooof', 'yip',];
dog.join();
= 'bark,wooof,yip'
vs
dog.join('-');
= 'bark-woof-yip'

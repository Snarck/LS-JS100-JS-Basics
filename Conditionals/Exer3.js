Yes? No? Part 2 (ternary operator)

Take your code from the previous exercise and rewrite the conditional so that it uses the ternary if-then-else operator.


Oh, shoot. I already did that, because I prefer ternary.  Will copy and paste it:

*/

let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());
//
// In ternary
console.log(randomNumber ? 'Yes!' : 'No!');
